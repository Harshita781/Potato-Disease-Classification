An intelligent system for the classification of potato diseases using machine learning.

## Overview

Potato Disease Classification is a project that leverages machine learning to identify and classify diseases affecting potato plants. The system incorporates a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for accurate disease detection.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive UI for easy interaction.
- **Advanced CNN Model:** Utilizes a powerful CNN model for disease classification.
- **FastAPI Integration:** Efficient server implementation using FastAPI.
- **Confidence Prediction:** Provides confidence levels for disease predictions.
